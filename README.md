# Internship Task – Quiz Application & Course API

## 📌 Overview
This project was built as part of an internship technical task.  
It consists of:

- A **frontend quiz application** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A **backend REST API** built using Node.js and Express to manage courses and track user progress.

The focus of this task was correctness, clarity, edge-case handling, and clean architecture rather than overengineering.
